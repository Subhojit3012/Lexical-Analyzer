# Lexical-Analyzer
This project implements a lexical analyzer that scans source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens. It identifies lexemes such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals while ignoring whitespace and comments. The generated tokens serve as input for further compiler or interpreter phases.
